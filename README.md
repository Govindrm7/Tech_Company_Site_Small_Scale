# Assignment Description

## Introduction
This assignment combines Node.js and React components to create a multi-page web application. It integrates a login system, REST API hierarchy, and separate pages using React Router.

## Assignment Tasks

1. **Connect Node.js with React Login Page**
   - Implemented a login page that verifies user credentials from the backend, using usernames and passwords stored in the database.
   - Followed a REST API folder hierarchy (`Server.js`, `router.js`, `controller.js`, `service.js`, `model.js`) for efficient backend organization.
  
2. **React Pages with Router**
   - Created 4 pages (`Home`, `About-us`, `Jobs`, `Contact`) using React components and React Router.
   - Maintained separate folder structures for each component to ensure code modularity and organization.
  
3. **Card Component Addition**
   - Integrated card components on each page to provide details about the respective pages.
   - Utilized `react-map()` to create dynamic components, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

4. **Design Enhancements**
   - Applied CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal of the pages, ensuring a pleasing user experience.

5. **Git Repository Upload**
   - Uploaded the assignment onto a Git repository.
   - Included a README file, explaining the assignment details comprehensively.
   - Added a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules` from version control.

## Additional Points
- Added a `Layout` page to facilitate `map()` functionality, providing a consistent layout across pages.
- Implemented a login page for user input to authenticate and access restricted content.
