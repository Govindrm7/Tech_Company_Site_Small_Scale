# Project Overview

This project comprises building a Node.js backend connected to a React frontend. It involves creating a login page that utilizes previously created usernames and passwords. Additionally, four React pages—Home, About Us, Jobs, and Contact—will be implemented using React components and React Router. Each page will have a card component detailing information about the respective page. Dynamic components will be created using `map()` on at least one page. CSS styling and additional text will be used to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the pages.

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Backend Integration

1. Connect the previous Node.js assignment to this task.
2. Create a login page that uses existing usernames and passwords from the previous assignment for successful logins.
3. Implement a REST API folder structure including `server.js`, `router.js`, `controller.js`, `service.js`, and `model.js`.

### Task 2: React Components and Router

1. Develop four pages (Home, About Us, Jobs, Contact) using separate folder structures for each React component.
2. Utilize React Router for navigation between these pages.

### Task 3: Card Components and Dynamic Rendering

1. Add a card component to each page, offering details about the respective page.
2. Use `map()` function to create at least one dynamic component, enhancing the page's interactivity.

### Task 4: Aesthetic Enhancements

1. Apply CSS styles to improve the visual appeal of the pages.
2. Include additional text content as required.

### Task 5: Git Repository Requirements

1. Upload the assignment to a Git repository.
2. Include a comprehensive README file explaining the assignment details.
3. Utilize `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules` from version control.
   - Ensure missing README and `.gitignore` files may result in point deductions.
